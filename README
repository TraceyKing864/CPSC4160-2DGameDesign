Project no: 6

Project due date: 5/2/18

Project description: This is the project is now a fully playable TRPG/SRPG.
  Things I added for this project:
  -Explosions on character death (as well as a sound effect on death)
  -Attack/ability animations (projectiles)
  -Added an AI
  -8 Unique abilities with unique menu and action animations
  -Fixed fullscreen (I added a render clear at the beginning of engine's draw step)
  -Music/Sound Effects (both of the background music tracks are midi files generated
      from another program I created that procedurally generates music)
  -Reset or quit game after game completion


The easiest part of this project: This project was the most fun I've had completing
  a project, so the easiest part of the project was being motivated to add more
  features.


Problems that I had in completing this project: As it turns out, I've had a bug in
  my program since project 3 in MultiSprite that never showed itself due to pure
  coincedence. The bug appeared after I had a different number of frames and animations
  and it took me an hour to realize it.
  Also, implementing a path finding algorithm for the AI proved to be very difficult
  as it's been awhile since Data Structures and Algorithms.


Note: change units_player/total and units_ai/total to 1 or 2 in the XML to make the
  game shorter. Additionally MALLOYMODE sets your attack and defense to 100


*Used free/open source sprites and fonts from this URL:
    https://opengameart.org/content/dawnlike-16x16-universal-rogue-like-tileset-v181
*Created my own UI/HUD elements
*Created many of the animations by using static images from the above link and
    modifying them to make them my own by scaling, rotating, adding new frames,
    and changing some colors
*Created the music myself*; both of the background music tracks are midi files
  generated from another program I created that procedurally generates music
